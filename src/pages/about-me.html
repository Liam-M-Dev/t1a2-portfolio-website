        <p>Hello! My name is Liam and I am currently studying at Coder Academy.</p>
        <p>I'm a creative person at heart that loves a challenge.
          I have a diploma of horticulture and find the natural world fascinating. Working within the garden industry has taught me a lot about presentation and patience. 
          What interests me with web development is the entire process and the acquiring the ability to translate an idea into  an artistic way.
          For a bit more info, here's my CV</p>

        <p>So now that you know a little about my history I would like to just blab about what I enjoy in life.
          I'm really into music, movies, poetry and making videos with my partner.
        </p> 
        <p>Being  able to explore multiple genres to experience different feelings and make myself think.
          Also I have a big board game and video game collection. I love to game with my friends and am always down for an 8hour epic board game like twilight imperium.
          Outside of all this I also really enjoy exploring the natural world, seeing how everything interacts with each other to create amazing ecosystems.
