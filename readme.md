### Purpose

The purpose of my web developer portfolio is to design and implement website portfolio that not only advertises myself and my brand to potential employers but also shows a strong message of my morals and who I am as a person.  
I am looking to present a web portfolio that highlights my views when it comes to visual media and functionality.  (fix this to avoid repeating myself)
