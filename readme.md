### Purpose

The purpose of my web developer portfolio is to not only advertise myself as a professional fullstack web developer but to also show viewers who I am as a person and where my interest/strengths lie. I am looking to present a web portfolio that highlights my views when it comes to visual media and functionality.  
I want to acheive a website portfolio that not only advertises myself and my brand to potential employers but also shows a strong message of my morals and who I am as a person.

### design ideas/process

For my design I am wanting to create an almost abrasive but visually inviting landing page with the ease of being able to reach my other pages whilst keeping a consistent tone and style.  
My interests with design dive deep into the world of outside art, with my portfolio looking to take on a minamalistic and brutalist approach in design.  

#### Pages

- landing page/index
- about me
- projects/work
- blog
- contact

#### Landing Page

For the landing page I would like to design something relatively minimalistic that has an eye catching feel to it. Achieving this with the basic logo/image, a little mission statement and links to other pages.  **(insert reference photos for landing page here)**  

#### other pages

This is grouped together as Ideally I would like my web pages to somewhat sit harmoniously.  
All pages I would like them to have a bit of a rough around the edges vibe but with easy functionality to reach other pages and links to outside sources/other forms of contact eg: github, linked in, etc.  

- for the about me section I am looking to have a small written part about myself, an Image of myself, the skills and interests that I have and a link to my resume.  
- blog section will be done in a somewhat card style with links to 5 seperate blogs.  
- projects/work is to look similar to the blog section but more imagery than actual text.  
- I like a simple contact form with some other seperate information about getting in contact and this is what I aim to achieve.
