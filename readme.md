### Purpose

The purpose of my web developer portfolio is to design and implement website portfolio that not only advertises myself and my brand to potential employers but also shows a strong message of my morals and who I am as a person.  
I am looking to present a web portfolio that highlights my views when it comes to visual media and functionality.

### design ideas/process

For my design I am wanting to create an almost abrasive but visually inviting landing page that sets the theme of my other pages.  
I am looking to design a web page that is easy to navigate and has functionality that is accessible for everyone.  

#### Pages

- landing page
- about me
- projects
- blog and blog posts
- contact

#### Landing Page

The landing page i

#### other pages

This is grouped together as Ideally I would like my web pages to somewhat sit harmoniously.  
All pages I would like them to have a bit of a rough around the edges vibe but with easy functionality to reach other pages and links to outside sources/other forms of contact eg: github, linked in, etc.  

- for the about me section I am looking to have a small written part about myself, an Image of myself, the skills and interests that I have and a link to my resume.  
- blog section will be done in a card style with links to 5 separate blogs.  
- projects/work is to look similar to the blog section but more imagery than actual text.  
- I like a simple contact form with some other separate information about getting in contact and this is what I aim to achieve.
